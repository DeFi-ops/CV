    <h3>Attributes</h3>
    <p>I have taught a number of people in blockchain and crypto currency over the years in the following areas</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ethereum</li>
        <li>Different types of blockchains and their infrastructures</li>
        <li>Blockchain and their use-cases</li>
        <li>Crypto currencies and their use-cases</li>
        <li>Public vs Private chains</li>
        <li>On-boarding</li>
        <li>Exchanges</li>
        <li>Various Wallets and their securities/vulnerabilities</li>
        <li>Scalability issues and trade-offs
        <li>Privacy features (ZKSnarks)
        <li>DeFi (decentralized finance)</li>
    <br>
    <p>Knowledge and great understanding on a technical level on how blockchains work depending on POS/POW model, utility, hash functions, wallet functions, hard & soft forks, consensus, miners, layer solutions for scalability(sharding/plasma) nodes, private & public keys/multi-sig and more.</p>
    <p>I enjoy talking about and educating in this field, and a natural people person, and relationship builder.
       I have some ideas of my own but also open to share ideas with a team/company to push forward.
    <p>The activities above ranged from educating in people's homes, to a few class room events, to speaking at two University events in the UK consisting of audiences of 20 to 30 people.</p>
